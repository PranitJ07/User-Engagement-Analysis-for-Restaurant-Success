# User-Engagement-Analysis-for-Restaurant-Success

# Problem Statement
In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders.
Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business
success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

# Research Objectives
1. Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and review count/average star rating:
   This will help us determine if restaurants with higher user engagement experience a corresponding increase in reviews and ratings.

2. Analyze the impact of sentiment on review count and average star rating: We will investigate if positive sentiment in reviews and tips translates to higher star 
   ratings and potentially influences the total number of reviews left.
   
3. Time trends in User Engagement: We will explore if consistent user engagement over time is a stronger indicator of long-term success compared to sporadic bursts 
   of activity.

# Hypothesis Testing
- Higher levels of user engagement (more reviews, tips, and check-ins) correlate with higher review counts and ratings for restaurants.
- Positive sentiment expressed in reviews and tips contributes to higher overall ratings and review counts for restaurants.
- Consistent engagement over time is positively associated with sustained business success for restaurants.
